create a unit test file with AI 
- tell AI, going to use 'vitest', and want to be in the samedir 
- pnpm add -D vite-tsconfig-paths
- vitest.config.mts file 
- package.json to add the line -> "test:unit": "vitest",
- pnpm run test:unit

usually in the utils file, will put the index.ts 
- use for exporting 
- from other place just import from "@/utils"

- tryout 

- add a favourite address list and amount, that can do straight transfer with just pressing a button


E2E testing basics (end to end testing)
- validate the whole process from start to finish 
- unit test -> a single function 

when the user not connected, won't show 
- show the airdrop form only if the user is connected with wallet 
- HomeContent file 
- wagmi hook -> useAccount()
- synpress (e2e testing framework)
- test on when we connected (show form), if not show (connect wallet)

pnpm create playwright@latest
pnpm exec playwright test
